## Key Technology Decisions

### Decision 1 — Jetpack Compose vs XML Views

Many stateful screens (transaction form, chart scrubbing, filter panels) with bilingual theming. Chose Compose + Material 3 exclusively. State-driven recomposition removes manual view invalidation; recomposition pitfalls are mitigated by `@Immutable` and `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000)`.

### Decision 2 — Clean Architecture (MVVM) vs Standard Android MVC

Rate conversion, commission rules, and home-currency logic must not depend on Android or Retrofit. Chose a layered split into `core/domain`, `core/data`, `feature/*`. `ConvertCurrencyUseCase` depends on `CurrencyRateProvider` bound via Hilt `@Binds`, keeping domain unit-testable. Trade-off: mapper boilerplate between entity and domain.

### Decision 3 — Custom CERPS Backend vs Direct Third-Party Rate API

Free-tier providers have low quotas and occasional outages. Chose CERPS as the only contract the Android app depends on, aggregating three providers by median on an 8-hour scheduler. Shields the client from provider instability, centralises AES-256-GCM key management, hosts the AI commission lookup. Trade-off: an extra service to deploy and monitor.

### Decision 4 — Custom Canvas Chart vs YCharts for Rate History

YCharts produced artefacts on flat periods, clipped the last point, and used non-monotone interpolation. Chose to redraw `RateHistoryScreen` on raw `Canvas` with PCHIP interpolation and LTTB downsampling. Removes ghost dips, keeps the last point visible, supports scrubbing with exact rate and Δ%. YCharts kept for the pie chart.
